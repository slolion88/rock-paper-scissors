My first JavaScript program, playing Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. 
I utilized several of the methods and shorthands we have covered in this lesson
and while I saw too late that we were to implement a playRound hit 5 rounds, but
I actually have the program running until the user cancels, which is a better user
experience.

**Update 10/29/2025 - a UI has been added, largely controlled by DOM Manipulation. 
It was a tough project, I started out with three different pages but then narrowed 
it down to one by manipulating the nodes. This is probably not how I would do this 
project in the long run but this was excellent practice and really helped me to 
understand how the nodes work. It was fun to bring CSS into the party as well. 

I am still struggling with the flow of removing and adding the nodes, it's hard to 
use a main function, so to speak, to call all of the functions, as they will all 
get called immediately. I think I might be thinking about the flow of execution 
from other programing languages and incorrectly comparing it to the flow that 
Javascript uses. I'm interested to see how my understanding of this concept changes 
over time. For now, this project is a wrap.
