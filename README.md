My first JavaScript program, playing Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. 
I utilized several of the methods and shorthands we have covered in this lesson
and while I saw too late that we were to implement a playRound hit 5 rounds, but
I actually have the program running until the user cancels, which is a better user
experience. ;)
